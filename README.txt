README File for Wordbank Project Visualization

To reproduce the wordbank visualizations, simply open the EDLD 652 Final Project.RProj, make sure that the EDLD 652 Final Project.Rmd file is open, and press "knit". This will generate the "Vocabulary Development Across Four Languages" dashboard .html file. This dashboard contains each of the three visualizations for review. 

Folder should contain:
	- EDLD 652 Final Project.Rmd
	- EDLD 652 Final Project.Rproj
	- README.txt
	- wordbank_bychild_data.csv (data for visualization 1 and 2)
	- wordbank_instrument_data (data for semantic network visualization)
